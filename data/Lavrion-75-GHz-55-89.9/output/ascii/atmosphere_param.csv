# This file is generated on 06-Dec-2021 at 12:05:32 and contains for each site:
# press = air total pressure (hPa); temp = air temperature (K); vap = water vapour density (g/m^3) and hl = height level of reference amsl (km).
# All parameters are computed by: ITU-R P.835-4 model on Mean annual period.
# Atmospheric results are sorted acording to the site identification number:
#    _ 1 = Lavrion 75GHz (Lat = 3.7720e+01 deg, Lon = 2.4048e+01 deg, Alt = 2.0000e-02 km)
# Stored values are organised as follow:
# Site number, height level of reference amsl (km), press (hPa), temp (K), vap (g/m^3)
1, 2.0000e-02, 1.0107e+03, 2.8802e+02, 7.4254e+00
